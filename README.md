# mastermind

The goal of this project is to:
1. Build a functional website using Python and Flask
2. Build a digital version of the Mastermind board game that can be played from the browser
  a. Gather and store data from the game to build datasets for later analysis

This project is a first on many levels for me:
1. First project on GitHub
2. First project using Python
  a. Also Flask, but learning Python is the main reason

Additional Info:
- The idea for the project came from Rob Percival via his Web Dev 2.0 Udemy course
- I am watching Corey Schafer's tutorial series to learn Flask (and Python as needed)
